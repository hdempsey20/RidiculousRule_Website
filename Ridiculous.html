<h1>Most Ridiculous Rule</h1>
<p>One ridiculous rule I have heard is that some teachers will choose what school supplies they want you to use for their class. I think you should be able to use what works best for you. Also, I feel that we are old enough to be able to decide what we want to use.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>
<p>Some of my teachers this year have required me to use certain school supplies. For example, my teacher would like us to use a binder instead of a notebook in chemistry.
